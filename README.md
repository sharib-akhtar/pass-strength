A Simple Password Strength Tester
My First minor project using html css and Javascript.
It is a simple tool that can be used to point out vulnerabilities present in a password.This tool will majorly help middle-aged and above in setting up a strong password.Middle-aged and above,who have less to no knowledge on how to create strong passwords, are more prone to data theft.It will create awareness among them about securing their private affairs.
It can assure strnegth to your random password.It takes in required information such as name, date of birth, phone number and password as input.It then checks whether the entered paassword is same as name or mobile number or date of birth.Many people nowadays tends to use their personal information as their password which is absolutely not recommended as anyone can have access to our personal infos.
This tool prompts the user to not use such details.
It also checks the length of the password and prompts the user if the password is less then 8 characters as well as when the password contains no special characters and numbers. To keep a passsword strong it is recommended that the passoword is greater than 8 characters and is formed by a combination of letters,numbers and special characters.
